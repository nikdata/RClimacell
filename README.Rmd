** WIP **
This package is still under development. Please use with caution. Functions have not been fully tested.

** NOTE **
THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL CLIMACELL PACKAGE. This package is not supported by Climacell.

The {RClimacell} package is an unofficial R package that enables basic interaction with Climacell's API. The functions within this package are tested against the [CORE data layers](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/data-layers-core). Using the functions within this package require a valid API key.

More information about the Climacell API can be found on their [docs](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/api-overview) page.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nikdata/RClimacell")
```
